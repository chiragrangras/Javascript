    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      It is Event based Programming Language.<br />
      When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”.
      But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning
      a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.
    </p>
    <p>We can use JavaScript In various thing like :-</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Client side scripting language</li>
      <li>Server side scripting language</li>
      <li>Mobile Development</li>
      <li>ML and AI</li>
      <li>Game Development</li>
      <li>Blockchain Development</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual
      machine”.
    </p>
    <p>Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.</li>
      <li>SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.</li>
      <li>
        There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “JavaScriptCore”,
        “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
      </li>
    </ol>
